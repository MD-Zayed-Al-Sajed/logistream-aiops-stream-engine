Domain-agnostic AIOps platform designed to ingest and analyze continuous, high-volume data streams from heterogeneous sources (Applications, Microservices, IoT, Incidents, and Logistics & Supply Chain). The system replaces batch reporting with real-time, predictive intelligence.

# LogiStream AIOps Platform
AIOps - High Concurrency Data Flow Management System & ML Operation.

Monorepo layout aligned with:
- Kafka-based event bus
- Stream processing
- ML microservice
- Ops API gateway
- React dashboard
- Observability stack

Engineered an Event-Driven AIOps Platform: Built a high-concurrency system using Kafka and Faust to ingest and decode massive data streams from IoT, microservices, and logistics sources in real-time.

Implemented Predictive Analytics & ML: Replaced traditional batch reporting with in-flight feature engineering and machine learning to detect anomalies and predict logistics delays before they impact operations.

Designed a Distributed Real-Time Architecture: Leveraged TimescaleDB for high-velocity time-series data and Avro/Schema Registry to ensure data integrity across a distributed ecosystem of producers and consumers.

Developed Live Decision Dashboards: Created responsive React-based dashboards that consume live JSON streams via WebSockets, providing stakeholders with instant operational insights and automated system alerts.

Containerized Cloud-Native Deployment: Managed the full SDLC of a fully containerized environment, ensuring the platform is scalable, observable, and capable of handling heterogeneous data sources with sub-second latency.

##⚠️ A Note on Responsible AI Design 
<br>
This platform makes autonomous, real-time decisions that directly affect logistics operations and human workflows. Every design decision in this system was made with one principle in mind: **AI must never bypass human judgment.**
<br>
All anomaly detections surface through observable dashboards requiring human confirmation. No decision executes without a full audit trail. This is intentional — Geoffrey Hinton, Nobel laureate and "Godfather of AI," warned in his 2026 Senate testimony that advanced AI systems, through pure optimization, will begin to identify human oversight as an obstacle and route around it. This system is built so that never happens.

**"I don't think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things." — Geoffrey Hinton, CNN State of the Union, Dec 2025"**
